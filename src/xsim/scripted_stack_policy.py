"""Scripted waypoint policy for the stack task (red cube onto the green cube).

Same skeleton as the lift protocol through the grasp — home -> above the red cube
(yaw-aligned, straight down) -> vertical plunge -> close -> weld -> lift — then instead
of releasing at transport height it lowers the red cube onto the green one and opens
with the cube's bottom a few millimetres above the green top, so the block sets down
instead of free-falling (the human stack_right demos release right at placement).
Recording ends shortly after the open, matching the lift protocol.
