"""Scripted waypoint policy for the block lift task.

Sequence (grifflee's 2026-07-02 protocol): home -> above the cube (high, yaw-aligned to
the cube faces, gripper straight down) -> vertical plunge -> close -> lift quickly ->
transport to the drop target on the table centerline -> brief closed hold at the target ->
open (cube drops). The episode ends at the release; there is no lowering-to-place and no
retreat, so the robot is never recorded moving away from a cube that is on the table.

Drives the env's ``Manipulator`` via ``go_to_goal`` with straight-line lerp per segment.
Waypoint quats differ (yaw alignment happens over the approach segment), so the lerped
quat is renormalized each step. The square block has 90-degree rotational symmetry, so
side-grasp yaw selection picks the equivalent face-aligned yaw closest to the current
wrist orientation instead of forcing a needless quarter-turn.
